## Overview
This document leverages the [growthbreaks](https://github.com/afsc-assessments/growthbreaks) R package to investigate potential spatio-temporal breaks, or clusters, in pacific cod growth across the range. There are some major caveats in analyzing these data wholesale, largely due to sampling changes through time -- so this investigation is intended to guide discussions and inference, *not* to be the final word on spatial demographic structure.
